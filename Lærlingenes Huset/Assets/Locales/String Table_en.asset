    m_Localized: "(PLACEHOLDER TEXT) As the looming climate crisis is becoming\r                                  
      directly apparent to most people, there is an increasing focus on how our buildings
      affect nature. This raises the question of whether it is better to demolish\r                                          
      the existing buildings and replace them with new low-energy buildings or gently
      insulate the old buildings.\nOf course, they will have a higher energy consumption
      for heating, which is increasingly covered by renewable energy, but\r                 
      on the other hand they have already strained nature during construction perhaps\r                              
      many years ago. Lifespan is therefore a very important parameter for assessing\r                            
      the overall environmental impact. Restoration architects are used to researching\r                                                    
      existing buildings to find out when they were built and what alterations they\r                                                    
      have undergone in the period up to now. "

    m_Localized: 'Restored as listed and with 75 mm internal wall insulation. It
      turns out that it has a substantial heat loss primarily due to the fact that
      it is only re-insulated with 75 mm inside on exterior walls. On the other hand,
      the thin post-insulation means that the proportions of the rooms are largely
      maintained and only little precious living space is lost.
